Tasks such as translation, classification, summarization and question answering, all of them are treated as a text-to-text conversion problem, rather than seen as separate unique problem statements.\n",
        "    - **Unified approach for NLP Deep Learning** - Since the task is reflected purely in the text input and output, you can use the same model, objective, training procedure, and decoding process to ANY task. Above framework can be used for any task - show Q&A, summarization, etc. \n",

        "New Delhi, Apr 25 (PTI) Union minister Vijay Goel today batted for the unification of the three municipal corporations in the national capital saying a discussion over the issue was pertinent. The BJP leader, who was confident of a good show by his party in the MCD polls, the results of which will be declared tomorrow, said the civic bodies needed to be \"revamped\" in order to deliver the services to the people more effectively. The first thing needed was a discussion on the unification of the three municipal corporations and there should also be an end to the practice of sending Delhi government officials to serve in the civic bodies, said the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs and Sports. \"Barring one, the two other civic bodies have been incurring losses. It would be more fruitful and efficient if all the three were merged,\" he said, referring to the north, south and east Delhi municipal corporations. The erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) was trifurcated into NDMC, SDMC and EDMC by the then Sheila Dikshit-led Delhi government in 2012. Goel predicted a \"thumping\" victory for the BJP in the MCD polls. He said the newly-elected BJP councillors will be trained on the functioning of the civic bodies and dealing with the bureaucracy. \n",

        "New Delhi, Apr 25 (PTI) The Income Tax department has issued a Rs 24,646 crore tax demand notice to Sahara Groups Aamby Valley Limited (AVL) after conducting a special audit of the company. The department, as part of a special investigation and audit into the account books of AVL, found that an income of over Rs 48,000 crore for a particular assessment year was allegedly not reflected in the record books of the firm and hence it raised a fresh tax demand and penalty amount on it. A Sahara Group spokesperson confirmed the development to PTI. \"Yes, the Income Tax Department has raised Rs 48,085.79 crores to the income of the Aamby Valley Limited with a total demand of income tax of Rs 24,646.96 crores on the Aamby Valley Limited,\" the spokesperson said in a brief statement. Officials said the notice was issued by the taxman in January this year after the special audit of AVLs income for the Assessment Year 2012-13 found that the parent firm had allegedly floated a clutch of Special Purpose Vehicles whose incomes were later accounted on the account of AVL as they were merged with the former in due course of time. The AVL, in its income return filed for AY 2012-13, had reflected a loss of few crores but the special I-T audit brought up the added income, a senior official said. The Supreme Court, last week, had asked the Bombay High Courts official liquidator to sell the Rs 34,000 crore worth of properties of Aamby Valley owned by the Sahara Group and directed its chief Subrata Roy to personally appear before it on April 28.  \n",
